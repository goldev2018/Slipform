									 <h3>The Company</h3>
									 <div class="solidline"></div>
										<p>In the early 1970’s Stewart Elliott (and Sir Gordon Wu) worked on the development and optimization of the Slipform process and technology and its application for the developments of large projects in Australia and in South East Asia.</p>
										<p>After successful completion of these projects, the process was introduced to Hong Kong  by Stewart Elliott  to take advantage of the growing Infrastructure development in Hong Kong at that time. Subsequently Slipform Engineering Ltd. was established in 1976 in Hong Kong. </p>
										<p>In early 1980 Hopewell Power (China) Ltd. required  an experienced Civil Contractor for their ‘Shajiao B’ Coal Fired Project at Guangdong, China. This Civil Contractor would be required to take on significant responsibilities</p>
										<p>It was not possible to secure this support from other recognized Contractors. Stewart Elliott and Sir Gordon Wu therefore appointed Slipform Engineering to take on this assignment. Slipform completed the works ahead of schedule in 22 months and received the British Construction Industry Award for this Project.</p>

											</a>

										<p>Thus Slipform Engineering evolved from acting as a specialist Civil Contractor into an International Project Engineering and Construction Management Contracting Company with proven Power Plant Construction capability. Subsequently Slipform actively developed its capabilities in Major Power Project Construction and other Major Infrastructures including Highways, Ports and Bridges.</p>
										<p>Slipform has contracted and built the following Major Power Plants:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Shajiao ‘B’ Power Station (2 x 350 MW Coal Fired)</li>
											<li>Shajiao ‘C’ Power Station (3 x 660 MW Coal Fired)</li>
											<li>Pagbilao Power Station (2 x 367.5 MW Coal Fired)</li>
											<li>Sual Power Station (2 x 600 MW Coal Fired)</li>
											<li>Navotas I & II Power Stations (3 x 70 MW & 1 x 105 MW Oil Fired)</li>
											<li>Power Barges (9 x 30MW = 270MW)</li>
											<li>Sengkang Expansion Projects (180 MW Gas Fired Combined Cycle Power Plant)</li>
											<strong>TOTAL OF 5380 MW</strong>
										</ul>

										<p>Slipform has submitted a Proposal to Energy World Corporation as EPC contractor for its announced development of  the 600/650 MW Combined Cycle Gas-fired Power Station at Pagbilao, Philippines located adjacent to the 735 MW power station previously built by Slipform Engineering.</p>
										<p>The EPC price submitted by Slipform is $533 Million USD for 650 MW (gross) CCGT plant – this is equivalent to $820,000 USD per MW.</p>

										<p>Slipform has already carried out the following works:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Overall Preliminary Design and Layout.</li>
											<li>Preliminary Site Survey and Soil Investigation</li>
											<li>Site Formation (Cutting of Soil, Grading, Leveling) done</li>
											<li>Survey for Temporary Jetty carried out.</li>
											<li>Technical coordination with Siemens</li>
											<li>Procurement and Logistic Services</li>
											<li>Generator Enclosure for the Gas Turbines already at site since Nov, 2013.</li>
											<li>Guards employed for Security.</li>
